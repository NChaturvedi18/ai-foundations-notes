# 📘 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Structured Study Notes

Welcome! This repository contains my personal, structured notes on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
The goal: Understand AI fundamentals before jumping into tools or frameworks.

## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

### What it is
AI refers to systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, pattern recognition, learning, and decision-making.

### Key ideas
- AI is often described as a **general problem-solver**.
- Intelligence ≠ understanding; many AI systems only **match symbols and patterns**.

### Weak AI vs Strong AI
- **Weak AI:** Task-specific systems (e.g., Siri, recommendation engines, expert systems).  
- **Strong AI:** Human-like intelligence across domains (still theoretical).

### Where this is used
- Chatbots, recommender systems, expert systems, automation tools

### Limitations
- Weak AI can appear intelligent without true understanding

## 2. Popular Uses of AI

### Predictive AI
- Learns from historical data to predict outcomes  
- Example: Amazon product recommendations

### Generative AI
- Learns from massive datasets to create new content (text, images, code)  
- Can adapt across multiple tasks

**Key takeaway:** More data generally improves prediction quality but increases risk of bias

---

## 3. The Rise of Machine Learning (ML)

### What is ML?
- Systems that learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
- Inspired by the human brain  
- Useful for large, complex datasets

### Why ML matters
- Enables systems to improve over time through experience

---

## 4. Common AI Systems

### Pattern recognition
- ML identifies patterns humans cannot easily explain  
- Used in insurance & healthcare

### Robotics
- Combines ML with sensors  
- Example: Self-driving cars, adaptive robots

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Enables machines to process and generate human language  
- Focuses on **context**, not just words

### Internet of Things (IoT)
- Devices collect real-world data for AI systems  
- Strong applications in healthcare & behavior prediction

## 5. Learning from Data

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled data  
- Example: Spam detection

### Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data  
- Example: Customer segmentation

### Data Models
- Represent what AI has learned  
- Continuously refined over time

---

## 6. Identifying Patterns

### Classification
- Predicts predefined categories  
- Example: Fraud detection

### Clustering
- Groups similar data without labels  
- Example: Market segmentation

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through rewards & penalties  
- Example: Recommendation strategies

---

## 7. Machine Learning Algorithms

**Key Algorithms:**
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Regression  
- Naive Bayes

**Selection principle:** Algorithm choice should follow the data and the problem

---

## 8. Model Fit and Accuracy

### Bias vs Variance
- Bias: Error from oversimplification  
- Variance: Error from over-complexity

### Overfitting & Underfitting
- Overfitting memorizes noise  
- Underfitting misses patterns

---

## 9. Artificial Neural Networks

### Structure
- Input layer  
- Hidden layers  
- Output layer

### Learning mechanism
- Weight adjustment  
- Bias tuning  
- Backpropagation

---

## 10. Improving Accuracy

### Cost function
- Measures prediction error

### Gradient descent
- Minimizes error iteratively

---

## 11. Rise of Generative AI

### Self-supervised learning
- Uses unlabeled data with pseudo-labels

### Foundation models
- Multi-purpose, general AI systems

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Predict next words based on probability  
- Do not truly understand meaning

---

## 12. Generative AI Architectures

### Diffusion models
- Learn by destroying and reconstructing images

### GANs
- Generator vs Discriminator competition

### VAEs
- Encode and reconstruct essential features

### Transformers
- Use attention to understand context  
- Power modern LLMs like ChatGPT

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

Modern AI systems combine **data, algorithms, and scale**.  
Understanding **limitations** is as important as understanding **capabilities**.
